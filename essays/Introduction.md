I decided to major in MIS because I wanted to develop my technological literacy (as someone who has little experience with programming). I understand the importance of technology in the field of accounting (my primary major) and believe that the skills I learn from MIS are valuable for the profession, which relies on technology and Accounting Information Systems specialists more and more every day. Also, I have many friends who are in MIS or who have graduated, and so far the content is very interesting to me and fun. I look forward to learning more.
