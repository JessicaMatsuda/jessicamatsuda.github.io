<h2>WOD 5.1: Variables and Data Types</h2>

The goal of this WOD is to replace all of the hard-coding in our HTML file with variables and to create a separate javascript file for the product data, which can be maintained on the side. Further details can be found from [Dr. Portâ€™s GitHub repository](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/050.variables_data_types/experience-SmartPhoneProducts1_variables.html).
